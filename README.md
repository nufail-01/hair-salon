## The Perfecct Cut 🎓

🎯 **Finished my second project – a responsive multi-page educational website.**

---

## 🚀 About the Project

Eduford is a responsive multi-page website built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**. This project was part of my ongoing web development practice to improve my frontend skills and understanding of responsive design.

From layout structure to mobile responsiveness, this build challenged me to think beyond how a site *looks*—and focus on how it *feels* across devices. Every section, from the clean hero banner to the polished footer, was crafted with usability and user experience in mind.

## 🧠 Reflections

Every project I build brings not only better code, but better **confidence**. It’s rewarding to see how even simple tools can bring big ideas to life. And honestly — turning concepts into real, working websites? Kinda addictive. 🔥

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
